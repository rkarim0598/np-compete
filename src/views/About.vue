    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      This product was created at the request of Every Kid a King, a foundation that is run by 
    students at Notre Dame for the purpose of helping provide funds to worthy nonprofits. Our mission is to raise awareness for local nonprofit organizations,
     while also increasing the amount of money we will be able to give to these wonderful organizations. 
    By emphasizing the use of social media, awareness of the different causes
     of nonprofits will be raised greatly in a very short amount of time. By 
     incorporating a similar form of voting and donating that we see in ND Day,
      we will better be able to distribute funds appropriately as well.
